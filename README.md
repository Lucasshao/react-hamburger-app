# react-hamburger-app

This is a front-end exercise in React for a mobile ordering app. It contains some basic React and JavaScript knowledge. The home page contains a search box, a food list, and a shopping cart. When an item is added, the shopping cart is displayed, and the button becomes active. When the shopping cart is clicked, a window will pop up showing the product details. When you click to pay, you will jump to the payment page.
